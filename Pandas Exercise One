"""If you do not have pandas or glob2 installed go to CMD (command prompt and type in:

    you can download Anaconda from Continuum Analytics which has pandas, numpy and a number

	making a list with files ending in ".txt" will save time instead of typing
	in each path seperately. Make sure you use the correct path when using glob2.glob("C:\\PATH\\*.txt")
  for this exercise i used 3 files, file, file2, file3
  each file was written as such:
  value
  10
  20
  30
  40
  
  file2 started at 100 and ended at 400, file3 started at 1000 and ended at 4000

""" 
	when i did this it only returned the mean of the first file, however i was
	able to write this in a much shorter way. pandas.read_csv(file).mean() will give you 
  the mean and the data type such as int, float
